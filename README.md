## About the purple_theme themes 💜

![alt text](https://github.com/yxyfer/CodingSetUp/blob/master/images/purple_theme_term.png "Terminal Theme Image")

- Two versions:
   - Vim
   - Mac terminal
- This two themes have been thought and made to work together.
- You will notice that the terminal theme is a bit darker than the vim theme because otherwise I had trouble differentiating them...
- they are easy on the eyes :).

[ACTIONS]:

   - stop
```

1. go in the `dotfiles` folder.
  ```sh
    cd ~/dotfiles # if dotfiles is at your root. 
  ```
2. source install
  ```sh
    source install
  ```
3. multiple options: 
  ```sh
    termi # to Install terminal profile
    vimi  # to Install vim profile (includes custom purple_theme)
    giti  # to Install git
  ```
4. if you're on a mac (with original terminal)
   
   you can import the purple_theme.terminal in the terminal configurations and set it to default
5. You're Done :) enjoy

## <a name="vim"></a> About the Vim Profile

- My personal Vim profile
- adds quite a lot of features.
- Includes a custom and fast status line

### <a name="vim_install"></a> Install Vim Profile
```sh
cd ~/dotfiles
source install
vimi

vim # Inside vim 
:PlugInstall
```

  - If you code in C you might want to run the following command as well:
```sh 
c_completion # installs C completion for YMC
```



[ ] TODO add features

## <a name="git"></a> About Git profile
  - Installation:

    giti "John Appleseed" john@hello.com johnyyyyy

## <a name="purple_themes"></a> About the purple_theme themes üíú
![alt text](https://github.com/yxyfer/dotfiles/blob/main/images/purple_theme_term.png "Terminal Theme Image")

- Two versions:
   - Vim
   - Mac terminal
- This two themes have been thought and made to work together.
- You will notice that the terminal theme is a bit darker than the vim theme because otherwise I had trouble differentiating them...
- they are easy on the eyes :).
